    "power. Explain why this quantity can be approximated as the ratio of the average and maximal power throughout the year. Estimate the load factor of the solar production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "When providing the capacity of a PV system, the nameplate power of the system is used which was measured under standard conditions (1000 W/m2 solar irradiance, AM1.5 spectrum, and a cell temperature of 25°C) which is approximately equivalent to a sunny day in western europe. Since the maximum solar power output in France will have appeared on a sunny day, the conditions on this day will be similar to the standard conditions used to determine the capacity  (in some regions irradiance might have been a bit higher than 1000 W/m2, in some other regions a bit lower). Thus, we can estimate the capacity by the maximum solar generation thorughout the year.\n",

    "As calculated below, the capacity factor (load factor) of Solar energy in France 2023 was approx. 0.189 .\n"
